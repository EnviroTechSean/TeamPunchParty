# TeamPunchParty
Data200s Group project

In this project, we combined data analysis and machine learning techniques to model air quality across various US counties. Using Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, our team constructed two linear regression models and successfully conducted a comprehensive analysis of emission data.

## dataset_A_preprocessing.ipynb
Originally copied from GHCN_data_preprocessing.ipynb in the dataset drive, we will likely tailor this to our needs. 

## Open questions:
See the "Emmissions questions" tab of the spreadsheet above. We can talk about transferring those questions to this readme or whatever long term organization we want.
